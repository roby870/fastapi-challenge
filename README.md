# fastapi-challenge

## Overview

Implement an API in FastAPI that:

Communicates with a database containing a users table with a basic structure as shown below:

A) | name | surname | email | user_level | password |

B) The possible values for user_level are: admin, user, guest

Adds user authentication using JWT. Create a login endpoint.

Creates a create_user endpoint to allow user creation. Only users with user_level=admin can create users.

Creates a list_users endpoint that includes search filters for the users table and returns a list of users that meet the search criteria, with pagination handled on the backend. Only users with user_level=admin or user can access this list.

Receives a GET request that retrieves the value of a counter for the number of times the create_user and list_users endpoints were called.

Every 5 minutes, increments a second counter and prints its value to a log or console.

Adds necessary logging.


## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (recommended version: 20.10 or higher).
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (recommended version: 1.29 or higher).

## .env file

This file contains the environment variables needed to run the application. As a template, we have included a .env.example file. Copy this file and rename it to .env. You can customize the database configuration and other environment variables according to your needs. Example values are provided.

## Ports

The application is exposed on port 8000, and the PostgreSQL database on port 5432 (for the application) and 5433 (for testing).

## How to run the application

Once you have cloned the repository, run `docker-compose build` in the root directory of the project and then `docker-compose up app`. If you donâ€™t want to see the output in the terminal and prefer to run in the background, you can execute `docker-compose up -d app`.

## Using Swagger

Once the application is up and running, you can test the API using Swagger. Swagger provides a graphical interface to interact with the API more easily.
Open your web browser and go to the following URL: http://localhost:8000/docs. On this page, you will find the automatically generated API documentation, and you will be able to test the available endpoints.

## User Seeds

The application includes predefined user seeds to facilitate manual testing. These users are automatically created when the database is initialized.

#### Default Users

Username: John. Password: G*qE/6r$. User level: admin.

Username: Jane. Password: G*qE/6r$. User level: user.

## Tests

You can run tests with `docker-compose run test`


## About the counters

The three implemented counters (create_user_counter, list_users_counter, and background_counter) are in-memory variables, not persistent; therefore, if the server stops, they will reset to 0 upon restarting. Another consequence of this is that if we have more than one instance running in production, each will have different counter values depending on the demand. If persistence of the counters is desired, they could be stored in a database. In any case, the events that increase the counters are logged in the app's log (app/app.log). 
It should also be noted that we consider total calls to /create_user and /list_users, including those made by unauthenticated or unauthorized users.
